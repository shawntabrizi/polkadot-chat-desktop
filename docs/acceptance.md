### `git status --short`

Run after the commit; see the commit report. The file cannot contain its own post-commit state.

### Not run

- `docs/milestones/M0.check.sh` as a whole: it calls `timeout`, which this machine does not have. See docs/questions.md.

### Extra manual check

A one-off Electron script (not committed) loaded `out/renderer/index.html` with the built preload and read the page after 4 s. Output line:

```
PROBE {"root":20802,"text":"Polkadot Chat Web\nPair with your phone\nNetwork \nDevnet\nPaseo\n\nSubmitted. Scan the code with the Polkadot app and approve this device.\n\nPairing link","desktop":{"version":"44.4.1"}}
```

So the React app mounts (not only `did-finish-load`) and `window.desktop.version` is `44.4.1`.
